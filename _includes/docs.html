              <h3>Who is this for</h3>
              <p>Although security is the key part of using CWS - it is not possible to achieve a level of security which will be demanded from many corporations, organizations or governments. To obtain such a degree of security, the best advice is to not use hosting or cloud services. As they will inherently be your achilles heel.</p>

              <p>CWS is aiming at improving security for others, who neither can nor will pay for additional security by either hosting data themselves or use other means of improved tools. The goal is not to achieve perfect security but to make life harder for hackers to read out data.</p>

              <p>If this is what is your goal, then CWS may be a tool which use can find useful in your chain.</p>


            
              <h3>Disclaimer</h3>



                <p>As stated above, CWS neither can nor will aim at perfect security. That said, the work with developing CWS has been with the primary focus on improving backend security, by ensuring that what is stored is all encrypted.</p>

                <p>Generally, there are 3 areas where the security will come up short:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><b>Hosting or Cloud Provider</b><br />
                  <i>If the hosting provider is not taking their customers data security seriously, either by not patching their software or protecting their services using firewalls. Then, CWS cannot give you a guarentee that your data is secure. As CWS requires that the underlying software to run Java &amp; Java EE must be properly updated.</i></li>
                  <li><b>Network Communication</b><br />
                  <i>CWS uses WebServices (REST / SOAP) for all requests. this means that
                  the communication must be properly secured with SSL. If not, then all
                  data send or received may be compromised, as it can be sniffed over the
                  net. As SSL is added to the containers, it is not part of CWS, and as
                  with patches &amp; firewalls, CWS relies on a proper setup.</i></li>
                  <li><b>Data Processing</b><br />
                  <i>During the processing of data, both the data and the keys will appear
                  in readable form in the memory of the host. It is possible for someone
                  with access to the hosts to make memory dumps, and this way obtain the
                  information.</i></li>
                </ul>

                <p>Of these shortcomings, the last sounds like the worst, but as CWS is
                suppose to be added between your Persistence Logic &amp; Database, the
                data is already present in other components and reading it out from those
                may be simpler. Put in short, the focus has been on improving the security
                of storing the data, not processing - hence the name <i>Crypto Store</i>.</p>


              <h3>Release Plan</h3>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>0.8</b> - <i>Scheduled for December, 2017.</i><br />
                  <i>REST Support, support for REST has been pending the completion of
                  the API.</i>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>0.9</b> - <i>Scheduled for January, 2018.</i><br />
                  <i>External Code &amp; Documentation review.</i>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>1.0</b> - <i>Scheduled for January 31, 2018</i><br />
                  <i>First public release - was scheduled for release end of December, 2017,
                  but as Java will <a href="https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8170157">include
                  unlimited strength encryption in the patch release in January,</a> it was
                  decided to push the release of CWS 1 month to update the default encryption
                  strength, so only if an earlier version of Java 8 is used, will it be
                  required to downgrade the strength.</i>
