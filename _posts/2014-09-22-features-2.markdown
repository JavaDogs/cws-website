  Technically, CWS is written in Java 8 / Java EE 7. This way, it should deploy in any Java EE 7+ compliant Containers or Java EE7+ Compliant Cloud and work. The database layer is written using JPA, so the underlying database can be changed to whichever is desired. The initially supported databases include H2, HyperSQL & PostgreSQL. Support for other databases can be made easily.
