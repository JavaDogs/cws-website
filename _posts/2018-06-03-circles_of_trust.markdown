CWS is based on a the following use cases:

<b>Use Case 1:</b> <i>Two or more parties wishes to securely share data.</i>

<b>Use Case 2:</b> <i>A Webshop needs a secure way to store customer data, so
only the relevant parties can access it.</i>

Introducing &quot;<b><i>Circles of Trust</i></b>&quot;, a simple concept, build
around the same principles as PGP (Pretty Good Privacy). Any member can create a
Circle, and add other members to it. CWS will then create a CircleKey, which is
used to encrypt and decrypt all the data, which the members wishes to exchange.
