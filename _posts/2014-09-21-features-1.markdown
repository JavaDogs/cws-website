  CWS, Cryptographic Web Store or Crypto Store - is designed to be used as a backend component in other systems, added between existing persistence layer and the database. It uses a combination of standard cryptographic operations to ensure that the stored data is saved enrypted in a way, so only those who should have access to it, can access it.
