CWS, is designed as a standalone component, which runs in any Java EE 7+ based
container. It is not relying on any third-party dependencies and via the REST or
SOAP based Web Services, it is possible to embed CWS into other systems as a
microservice or use it as a backend component for other applications, websites,
or mobile apps.

Since CWS is build around Java EE and thus relies on JPA (Java Persistence API)
for database communication, any RDBMS will work. For the cryptographic
operations, JCE (Java Cryptography Extension) is used, so problems or errors in
this will be corrected by the Java system.
